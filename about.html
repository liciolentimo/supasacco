                     <h2>Overview</h2>
                  
                   				  
                <p>SUPA SACCO was registered in 1988 under the cooperative ACT cap. 490. as a cooperative society
				(CS No.5142). The idea of its conception started with twelve butchers who wanted to support
				each other to raise funds on a merry-go- round basis to improve their businesses. The Sacco was
				registered as Samburu Traders Sacco but has since re-branded to Supa Sacco Society Limited to
				enable it extend its services to people out of its common bond, to include: teachers, the Business
				community, farmers and individuals within the Samburu region and the county at large.</p>
				<p>The Sacco membership presently stands at 1432, growth realized during the 2010 – 2014 strategic
				plan. The Sacco has the potential of recruiting more members exploiting and targeting new markets
				and making more outreaches.</p>
				<p>The review seminar revaluated the vision and mission statement of Supa Sacco and amended it
				to reflect what the Sacco aims to achieve within the five (5) to ten (10) years, (2015 to 2024). The
				new vision and mission statement will among other things enable the Sacco to pull together in a
				unified purpose and direction and also enable Supa Sacco mobilize more resources by developing
				products and services that allows members to develop long term commitment and investment by
				members for life.</p>
				<p>The Sacco through this plan will introduce schemes such as; forming a housing Sacco, that can
				engage in land and plot buying for members, facilitation of projects to help members acquire
				capital assets, such as Buses, Trucks for transport, tractors and even dairy and milk processing
				equipment, beside savings and development plans for members of staff. They would also like
				to introduced Loans in kind, Farm inputs iron sheet among other new products. In drawing this
				Strategic Plan, the Board desired to reposition Supa Sacco to cope with the fast changing financial
				environment in the county today while at the same time maximizing its opportunities to capture
				market share beyond Samburu County.</p>
				<p>Secondly, to address the challenges posed by the competition; that has led loss of members. On
				products and services diversification, the team noted that members were now more enlightened and
				exposed to variety of services offered by the commercial banks and micro-finance institutions; the
				Sacco therefore seeks unlock its potential and exploit its opportunities to remain competitive.</p>
				<p>The primary business of the society is to provide a savings avenue to members and advancing
				loans to them. In addition to providing savings and loans facilities to the members, the society
				has set up FOSA operations (branches) to reach the wider market.</p>
				<p>If SUPA SACCO has to remain successful, it has to respond to these and other emerging changes
				adequately. It is in recognition of this fact that the current strategic plan and its subsequent review
				was formulated. It will form the basis of SUPA SACCO activities over the next five years.</p>
